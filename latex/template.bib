   abstract = {A brief historical introduction is given to the problem of covering a line by random overlapping intervals. The problem for equal intervals was first solved by Whitworth in the 1890s. A brief resume is given of his solution. The advantages of the present author's approach, which uses a Poisson process, are outlined, and a solution is derived by Laplace transforms. The method of Hammersley for dealing with a stochastic distribution of intervals is described, and a solution can still be derived by Laplace transforms. The asymptotic behavior as the line becomes long is calculated and is related to the one-dimensional continuum percolation problem. It is shown that as long as the mean interval size is finite, the probability of complete coverage decays exponentially, so that the critical percolation probability p c =1. However, as soon as the mean interval size becomes infinite, the critical percolation probability p c switches to 0. This is in accord with previous results for a lattice model by Chinese workers, but differs from those of Schulman. A possible reason for the discrepancy is a difference in boundary conditions.},

   abstract = {We present two new algorithms, Arc Length and Peer Count , for choosing a peer uniformly at random from the set of all peers in Chord (Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2001 Technical Conference, 2001 ). We show analytically that, in expectation, both algorithms have latency O (log n ) and send O (log n ) messages. Moreover, we show empirically that the average latency and message cost of Arc Length is 10.01log n and that the average latency and message cost of Peer Count is 20.02log n . To the best of our knowledge, these two algorithms are the first fully distributed algorithms for choosing a peer uniformly at random from the set of all peers in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). Our motivation for studying this problem is threefold: to enable data collection by statistically rigorous sampling methods; to provide support for randomized, distributed algorithms over peer-to-peer networks; and to support the creation and maintenance of random links, and thereby offer a simple means of improving fault-tolerance.},
